# Starship Troopers Game Tie-In
An HTML5 game using JS as the engine to celebrate the 20th anniversary release of Starship Troopers

In our game, John Rico moves on the screen and bugs come in from the sides. John shoots the bugs and increases his score each bug shot.

This game uses an HTML page, as well as CSS and JavaScript for functionality. The game can be played on all browsers.

Enjoy! :)
